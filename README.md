## Vale

Vale is an in-development open source engine that plays Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (UTTT).  
Oriented to be fast and precise, but it's a long way before completion.  

Currently provides a console interface for a user to interact with a board.  
Meant to be used via interface program using similar to UCI protocol (in progress).
