## Vale

Vale is an in-development open source engine that plays Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (UTTT).  
Vale is oriented to be fast and precise, but it's a long way before completion.  

![Showcase](https://github.com/N1ckn1ght/my-gif-collection-for-github/blob/master/vale_v0.1.0-beta.gif?raw=true)

Currently provides a console interface for a user to interact with a board.
